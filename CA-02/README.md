# CA-02 Naive Bayes Spam Filter


## Description
CA02: This is an E-mail Spam Classifer that uses the Naive Bayes supervised machine learning algorithm. 

This was coded for a graduate business analytics course. As part of the assignment, sample code was provided for reading and vectorizing the emails. I have provided annotation, made updates, and added the naive bayes algorithm to predict spam.

## Data Source
The data source for this project is not publicly available at this time, however, the code may still be referenced.

## IMPORTANT NOTE

The path of your data folders 'train-mails' and 'test-mails' must be './train-mails' and './test-mails'. This means you must have your .ipynb file and these folders in the SAME FOLDER in your laptop or Google Drive. The reason for doing this is, this way the peer reviewes and I would be able to run your code from our computers using this exact same relative path, irrespective of our folder hierarchy.

## Versioning
This code was generated on JupyterLab version 4.2.5. The code may need to be updated for use in later versions.

## Packages
The following packages were used. These must be installed prior to running the code if not already installed. <br>
